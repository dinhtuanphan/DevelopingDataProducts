## R Markdown and Leaflet
### Instructions
- Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. 

- Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

- Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!
