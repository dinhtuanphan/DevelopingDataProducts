knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning=FALSE)
defaultW <- getOption("warn") 
options(warn = -1) 

```


## Overview

Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity! 

## Slide with Bullets

- Load data


```{r cars, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
data('mtcars')
library(plotly)
```

- Summary data
```{r}
head(mtcars)
```



## Interactive Plot created with Plotly

```{r}
plot_ly(data=mtcars,x=~hp,y=~mpg,color = ~factor(cyl),
size=~wt,type="scatter",mode="markers")
```
